This project is a JSON parser written in Golang. It is designed to parse JSON data efficiently and accurately, providing a simple interface for users to work with JSON structures.

At the time of this commit, the project is in its early stages, and the code is not yet fully functional. The goal is to create a robust JSON parser that can handle various JSON formats and provide useful features for developers.

Currently, the code simply checks for matching opening and closing braces in a JSON string. It is a starting point for building a more comprehensive JSON parser.
